# Rock Paper Scissors Game
Rock Paper Scissors game that is played against the computer. The aim of the Rock Paper Scissors project was to begin applying my JavaScript knowledge.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Firstly started with my JavaScript game logic and ran the game out of the console to test logic was correct. From there i built out my HTML and styled it with CSS for my user interface. I  went back to my JavaScript file and started applying DOM methods to be able to play the game with a ui.

## Optimizations

First assignment was to just get the game running in the console, from there i had to refactor some of my existing JavaScript to be able to get it working with a user interface.

## Lessons Learned:

  * How to create a function to generate random selection of the following array [Rock, Paper, or Scissors].
  * How add and remove images in the DOM
  * How to add an event listener to a array of buttons.
  * Adding HTML to the DOM using JavaScript
  * How to allow the app to work with multiple size screens.
